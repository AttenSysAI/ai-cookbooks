    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how to use **VLM Run Orion** to analyze injury images and provide comprehensive emergency first aid guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Structured Prompts**: Well-structured prompts with clear instructions for visual assessment, action steps, safety precautions, and triage advice produce reliable results.\n",
    "2. **Session Management**: Use `session_id` to track your diagnosis requests.\n",
    "3. **Image Input**: Provide clear, representative images of injuries for best results.\n",
    "4. **Structured Output**: The model returns comprehensive first aid guidance in a structured format, including severity assessment, step-by-step protocols, and triage recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Disclaimer\n",
    "\n",
    "**This tool is for educational and training purposes only.** Always seek professional medical assistance for actual emergencies. In life-threatening situations, call emergency services (911 in the US) immediately. This guidance should complement, not replace, professional medical expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with different types of injuries (burns, cuts, sprains, etc.)\n",
    "- Use this for first aid training and certification preparation\n",
    "- Explore the [VLM Run Documentation](https://docs.vlm.run) for more capabilities\n",
