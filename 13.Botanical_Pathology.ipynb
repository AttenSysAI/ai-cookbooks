    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how to use **VLM Run Orion** to identify plant diseases and generate treatment plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expert Systems**: By prompting the model to act as a specific expert (Plant Pathologist), we ensure the output is technically accurate and well-structured.\n",
    "2. **Visual Diagnosis**: The model combines visual features (lesions, patterns) to deduce the underlying pathogen.\n",
    "3. **Actionable Advice**: The output is not just a label but a complete management guide for the grower.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Upload different plant species to test the model's adaptability.\n",
    "- Integrate with a real-time camera feed for a field diagnostic app.\n",
    "- Explore the [VLM Run Documentation](https://docs.vlm.run) for more capabilities.\n",
