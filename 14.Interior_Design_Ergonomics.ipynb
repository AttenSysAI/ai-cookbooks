    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how to use **VLM Run Orion** to perform an ergonomics audit of a workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Human Factors Analysis**: The model can evaluate the physical relationship between a user and their environment using only visual cues.\n",
    "2. **Preventative Healthcare**: By identifying risk factors for MSDs, this tool can serve as a first-line assessment for occupational health.\n",
    "3. **Structured Advice**: Grouping recommendations into \"Immediate,\" \"Behavioral,\" and \"Equipment\" makes the advice practical and easy to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the model to assess standing desk setups.\n",
    "- Integrate with a chatbot to interactive ergonomic coaching.\n",
    "- Explore the [VLM Run Documentation](https://docs.vlm.run) for more capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stay healthy and comfortable! 🪑"
