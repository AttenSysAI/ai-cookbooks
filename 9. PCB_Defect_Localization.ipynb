        "2. **Session Management**: Use `session_id` to track your inspection requests.\n",
        "3. **Image Input**: Provide clear, high-quality images of PCBs for best results.\n",

        "- Experiment with different types of PCB images and defect categories\n",
        "- Try analyzing boards with varying complexity and component density\n",
        "- Explore the [VLM Run Documentation](https://docs.vlm.run) for more capabilities\n",
